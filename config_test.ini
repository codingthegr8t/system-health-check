# If you want to ignore some components just add values that the system will never reach (Example: set values for cpu_threshold = 101). This way you can disable the compoments that you don't want to monitor.

# Disk threshold in percent(%). If the available disk space falls below this percentage, a warning will be triggered.
# GENERAL INFO: Disk availability threshold of 20-25% would give you more time to respond to space issues (such as by deleting unnecessary files or adding more storage) before the disk becomes completely full.
# DEFAULT VALUE = 20
disk_threshold = 20

# CPU threshold in percent(%). If the CPU usage exceeds this value, a warning will be triggered.
# GENERAL INFO: CPU usage threshold of 85-90% is common. If your CPU usage consistently exceeds this level, it could indicate that your system is under-provisioned for the workload it's running, leading to slower performance.
# DEFAULT VALUE = 90
cpu_threshold = 90

# RAM threshold in percent(%). If the RAM usage exceeds this value, a warning will be triggered
# GENERAL INFO: RAM usage threshold of 85-90% is often used. If your system consistently exceeds this level of RAM usage, it may start swapping memory to disk, which can significantly slow down your system.
# DEFAULT VALUE = 90

# GPU threshold in percent(%) and Temperature in celsius(â„ƒ). If the GPU usage exceeds this value, a warning will be triggerd
# GENERAL INFO: 
#   GPU Utilization    | For intensive tasks like gaming or deep learning, it's normal for the GPU utilization to be very high (e.g., 90-100%). This simply means that the GPU is being fully utilized. 
#                                 If you're seeing level of utilization 90-100% when no GPU-intensive tasks are running, it might indicate a problem such as a runaway process or malware.
#   Memory Utilization | Similar to GPU utilization, But if it's consistently at or near 100%, even when not running such tasks, this could be a sign of a problem. High GPU memory utilization can lead to issues like slower performance or out-of-memory errors.
#   Temperature        | Each GPU model has a different maximum safe temperature, but a good general threshold is around 80-85 degrees Celsius.
# DEFAULT gpu_threshold = 95
# DEFAULT gpu_memory_threshold = 98
# DEFAULT gpu_temp_threshold = 85
gpu_threshold = 95
